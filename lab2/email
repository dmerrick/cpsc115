Professor,

Some things you wanted to know:

1) Here is the shell script I use. I have it in ~/bin, and ~/bin in my $PATH. Be sure to "chmod +x" it.

############# Start DrJava Shell Script ###############
#!/bin/sh
java -jar /path/to/drjava/file.jar
############# End DrJava Shell Script ###############

2) To add this as an icon, right click on the panel (in KDE), choose "Add application to panel"->"Add non-KDE application"

Copy the second line from the above shell script into the "excecutable" field and fill in the other fields as desired.

There may be an easier way to do this, but I'd have to look into it.

3) To ssh with X11 forwarding, "ssh -X user@host"
It's VERY useful! (Note: DrJava doesn't tend to play nice. I haven't taken the time to look into this, because I perfer vim.)

4) The errors you requested are in the attatched tarball, or in my home directory under /home/dmerrick/cpsc115/lab2/errors.tar.gz

Happy coding,
